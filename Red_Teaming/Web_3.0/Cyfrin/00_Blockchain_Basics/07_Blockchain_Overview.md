# Consesnus

Consensus Mechanism

Consists of **Chain Selection** and **Sybil Resistance** (not for ETH2)

From Prof of Work to an proof of State 
- Who is the author ()

POW (Proof of Work) | Computation of Blocks(find first 0000) Blocktime higher when problemsolving is high

Chain Selection Role
What is the true blockchain? 

Consenus Algorithm in Bitcoin | nakamoto consensus

PoW + Longest Chain [lock-confirmation (e.g. three new blocks)]

BlockReward (directly from blockchain) + Transaction Fee (from Users to miners)

**Attacks**

Sybil Attack <-- pseudoanonymous accounts try to manipulate; prevented thorugh PoW and PoS

51% Attack


**addition**

PoW is very energy consuming 

Proof of Stake (PoS) 
- Miners are Validators (no mining)
- Validator is randomly chosen (rest is validating)
- Collateral behaviour
- lose Stake when they missbehave
- minimum Stake has to be put on Account

**Scaleability** 

Layer1: Base Layer Blockchain e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Everlange

Layer2: Added on top of a Layer1 Blockchain e.g. ChainLink, Optimism, Arbetrum

Optimism, Arbetrum <-- are rollups and solve scaleability

Rollups rollup transacation on Layer1

Sidechains have own security while rollups based on Layer1 security
