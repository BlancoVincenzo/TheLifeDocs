zkSync <-- Deploying Smart Contracts

# What is a blockchain? 
Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto
Peer-To-Peer Transactions in a decentralized network
Seen as Superior Digtial Store of Value

## Ethereum (Protocol uses Blockchain Features) by Viatlik Buterin
- Dezentralized Transactions (like Bitcoin) and..
- Dezentralized Agreements (Smart Contracts)
- Dezentalized Organisations

### Smart Contracts 
- set of instructions executed dezentralized
- no third party needed
- written in code 
- embodied in dezentralized platform

**Bitcoin is turning incomplete; manily for data-storage**

**Ethereum has store of value and utility for dezentralized agreements**

**The Oracle Problem**
- Blockchains are intentionally walled off (system works on its own)
- Agreements (Smart Contracts) need external data

--> Oracales: Connect Blockchain with off-chain data

Need of Dezentralized Oracle Network to stay Dezentralzied; Dezentralzied Computation to valid data

--> Onchain Logic AND Off-Chain data and computation `dezentralized`
--> Hybrid Smart Contracts (On-Chain & Off-Chain Agreements)

### Chainlink (Protocol)
- Modular dezentralized Oracle Netowrk
- off-chain data & computation --> blockchain

**Blockchain/SmartContractPlatform: Ethereumn,Avelin, Polygon, Phantom, Harmony**

### Layer2
- solve the Problem of Scalebality of a blockchain
- two types: optimistic rollup & zero knowledge roleup
- 


### Dapp = Combination of Smart Contracts


### What is the value of smart conracts? 
- create trust minimized agreements
- unbreakable promisses
