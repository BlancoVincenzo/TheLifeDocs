# What is the purpose of Smart Contracts
- Smart Contract = Vertraege (Kaufvertrag, Mietvertrag, etc.)
- Will they break their promise? can I trust the provider?
e.g. Banks promise to safe money securely <-- banks do invest money

Smart Contract as an tool, which is a agreement contract / set of instructions deployed on a dezentralized blockchain

Once a Smart Contract is deployed on the blockchain...
- cant be altered (changed) --> immutable 
- automatically exceuted
- public terms of agreement
- code is executed by all peers; no central authority
- singel point of failure (central authority) is gone --> TRUST is through blockchain significanntly higher

## Dezentalized Exchanges
like UNISWAP

**from Brand Based towards math based**

Trust Minimized Contracts aka Unbreakable Promises because of tarnsparency and no alter options
