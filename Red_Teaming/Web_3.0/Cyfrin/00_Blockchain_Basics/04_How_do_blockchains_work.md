# Hashing 

- Arbitrary input to unique fixed length output
- for Data Integrity
- one-way-function
- Ethereum uses Keccak256 Hashing

# Block

Block, Nonce, Data -> Hash

Miners hve to find Hash starting with 4 Zeros at the start

Find Nonce (thorugh Bruteforcing) that solve the problem

# Blockchain

- Block Nbr. 
- Nonce
- Previous
- Prev. Hash  

Previous Hash as input for the next hash
Genesis Block = the first hash of the blockchain (like IV)

One who has different block hash than the others will be kicked out (51% attack)

# Tokens
- Transaction section (before data)

## Mining
